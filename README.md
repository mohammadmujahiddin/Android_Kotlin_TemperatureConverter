Temperature Converter App in Kotlin 🌡️
I'm excited to share this app, and it's all about creating a Temperature Converter App in Kotlin! 📱❄️☀️
This app allows users to effortlessly convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa, making it a handy tool for everyday use. Kotlin, the officially announced Android language, proved to be the perfect choice for this project. It's amazing to witness its power in action.
The journey has been both educational and enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to the upcoming tasks as I continue to explore the world of app development.

Here's the video demonstration of the app https://github.com/mohammadmujahiddin/Android_Kotlin_TemperatureConverter/blob/master/Temperature_Converter.mp4
